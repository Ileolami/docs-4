The responsibilities of Navision (NAV/Business Central) developers and designers follow this structured process to ensure high-quality development and deployment. Below is a breakdown of each step in their workflow:

<Steps> 
    <Step title="Documentation Review"> The team begins by thoroughly reviewing this functional and technical documentation. This includes understanding the business requirements, identifying affected modules, and clarifying any uncertainties with stakeholders. This step ensures that the team has a clear grasp of the desired outcomes before any development begins. </Step> 
    <Step title="Time Estimation"> After reviewing the documentation, the team proceeds to estimate the development effort. This involves breaking down tasks, assessing complexity, identifying dependencies, and assigning realistic timelines. Accurate time estimation helps in resource planning and setting stakeholder expectations. </Step> 
    <Step title="Development, Testing, and Iteration"> The development work is carried out based on the approved requirements. Each change or feature is tested in a development environment. If issues are found, the code is reworked and retested until it meets functional and performance expectations. This iterative process ensures a stable and reliable solution. </Step> 
    <Step title="Development Environment Approval"> Once the initial testing is complete and the solution is stable, the changes are submitted for approval in the development environment. This step involves internal review and validation by quality assurance or project leads to confirm that the development meets predefined standards. </Step> 
    <Step title="Migration to Test Environment"> Upon receiving approval, the modified solution is migrated to the test (staging) environment. Further testing is conducted to simulate real-world scenarios and ensure system-wide stability. </Step> 
    <Step title="Deployment to Production Environment"> After successful testing and final approval, the validated modification is deployed to the production environment. This marks the final step, where the solution becomes live and available to use. </Step>
