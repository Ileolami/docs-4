The **ePump Project** is designed to digitize and streamline fuel dispensing operations across stations by capturing real-time pump readings, tracking sales, and generating insightful reports. This system ensures accuracy in fuel volume monitoring, supports pricing changes during the day, and allows for performance evaluation of pumps and sales personnel.

This API reference provides access to key endpoints that power the ePump system. These endpoints enable developers and integrators to:

- Capture pump meter readings at specific times of the day

- Handle mid-day price changes with separate recording logic

- Calculate daily pump sales using start and end readings

- Generate performance reports based on pump usage and revenue

- Monitor pump statuses, including disconnections or offline behavior

Use this reference to integrate the ePump system with your applications or dashboards, automate reporting, or extend fuel management capabilities within your organization.
